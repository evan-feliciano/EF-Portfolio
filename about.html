           <p>Before working in the tech industry four years ago, I had never heard the term UX Design. Fastforward less than a year  later and I was designing in Adobe XD and Sketch regularly as part of a marketing and experience team. I joined as one of the first 15 employees and our company didn’t have the funding to hire a designer at the time. I was creative, a fast learner, and one day someone saw me sketching for fun during my lunch break. From then on I was asked to pick up tasks like user research, wireframing, prototyping, and much more. This was when I began to realize not only my skills in creative design, but my passion for UX Design as a field of work.</p>

           <h2>To me, design is a way of solving highly complex problems with strategic and creative solutions.</h2>
           <p>Thinking outside the box is not only encouraged, but actually necessary for finding new and innovative ways to approach the user experience. Coming from a marketing background in school, I understood the importance of user behavior and needs from a business perspective, and UX Design felt like the perfect way to make an impact in that area. I see UX Design as providing users with products that not only feel and look good, but also work and function well. Combining both beauty and functionality shapes the future to be both better and brighter.</p>
           <p>Working in tech has taught me both the fragility and purpose that work can bring. Just before the COVID-19 outbreak, I was one of the many employees laid off due to budget cuts and fundraising issues. This was my first full time job, and at first I felt lost. But I took the time to surround myself with close friends, family, mentors, and even adopted a puppy. I refocused my energy and used that time to reconnect with work; I started new projects I had been talking about, did more research on skills I wanted to develop, and rekindled some of my passions, like playing the piano. I am now even more inspired and determined than ever to push forward in my career as a UX Designer, and have had the time to put myself in a position to do so successfully, with all the right tools and skills at my disposal. Connect with me and let’s find out how I can bring my passion for UX Design to help solve your user’s needs and provide them with a great product experience!
